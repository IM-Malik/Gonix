The pkg/nginx directory holds the public API that other projects can import. Splitting by functionality (config, sites, modules) keeps each domain focused and easier to test.


The cmd/ directory provides a place for a CLI interface if you later decide to let users run your automation directly from the command line.


Utility code that isn’t part of your public API goes into the internal/ folder. This can include logging, file operations, or other helper functions.


Having separate directories for unit and integration tests ensures you can run automated tests easily, and a docs/ directory helps users understand how to use your library.

automator.go acts as the central orchestrator for your library. It combines and coordinates the individual functionalities (like modifying configuration files, handling sites and modules) into higher-level operations that users can call directly. For example, it might expose functions such as ApplyChanges() or ReloadNginx() that internally call the functions in the config, sites, and modules packages.

-----

The fileops.go file contains helper functions related to file operations that are common across your project. Instead of writing the same file manipulation or error-handling code in multiple places (e.g., in available.go or other modules), you abstract these common tasks into fileops.go. This keeps your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and improves maintainability.
This might include functions to:
	* File Operations:
		- open, read, and write files.
		- change file permissions.
		- create, delete, or move files.
		- create symbolic links.

	* Error Handling
		- Provide standardized error wrappers or utility functions that make error checking and reporting more consistent.
		- For example, you might have a helper function that logs an error and returns a custom error type, or one that ensures cleanup actions are taken if an operation fails.


-----

logger.go is intended to encapsulate your logging functionality. Even if you use Go's built-in log package, creating your own logger module can:
	* Purpose:
		- standardize logging formats.
		- allow easier configuration of logs levels (e.g., INFO, WARN, ERROR).

	* Suggestions:
		- a basic logger wrapper that initializes a logger with a custom prefix and log level.
		- functions like Info(), Warn(), Error(), etc., which can be called throughout the projcet.
		- optionally, a configuration function that sets up output destinations (stdout, file, etc).
	* Example Snippet:
		package logger

		import (
		"log"
		"os"
		)

		var (
		Info  *log.Logger
		Warn  *log.Logger
		Error *log.Logger
		)

		func InitLogger() {
			Info = log.New(os.Stdout, "INFO: ", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)
			Warn = log.New(os.Stdout, "WARN: ", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)
			Error = log.New(os.Stderr, "ERROR: ", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Lshortfile)
		}
	* Benifit:
		- Centralizing logging helps ensure that your project’s logs are consistent and that any changes to how logging is handled only need to be made in one place.

- **Unit Testing:**
  - **Scope:**  
    Test individual functions in isolation. For example, test that your file operation functions correctly handle reading, writing, or modifying file permissions.
  
  - **Approach:**  
    - Create temporary files or directories during tests using Go’s `ioutil.TempDir` or `os.CreateTemp`.
    - Assert expected outcomes, such as file content changes or proper error returns.
    - Use table-driven tests for functions that handle different scenarios.

  - **Example:**  
    In `config_test.go`, you might test that given an initial `nginx.conf`, your function correctly adds or removes a configuration block.

- **Integration Testing:**
  - **Scope:**  
    Test the interaction between multiple parts of your project. For example, simulate an entire automation cycle: modify the `nginx.conf`, update a site configuration in `/sites-available`, create a symbolic link in `/sites-enabled`, and then trigger a mock reload of nginx.
  
  - **Approach:**  
    - Set up a controlled environment using temporary directories that mimic the real directory structure (e.g., creating temporary `sites-available` and `sites-enabled` directories).
    - Run the automation process as a whole and verify that all files and links are updated correctly.
    - Clean up the temporary environment after tests complete.

  - **Tools:**  
    - Use Go’s built-in testing framework (`testing` package).
    - Consider using libraries like `testify` for more expressive assertions.

- **Additional Considerations:**  
  - **Mocking:**  
    For parts of your system that interact with the OS (like reloading nginx), you may need to abstract these calls so they can be mocked during testing.
  
  - **Test Coverage:**  
    Ensure that your tests cover both the “happy path” scenarios (where everything works as expected) and error scenarios (e.g., file not found, permission denied).

By breaking down your components this way and adopting a clear separation of concerns, you can create a maintainable, testable, and scalable automation library for nginx.
