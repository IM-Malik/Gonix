- Backup and restore site configurations
- Utility functions for reloading, restarting, and testing Nginx

)

func main() {
    defaults := &orch.Defaults{
        NginxConf:      "/etc/nginx/",

        SitesEnabled:   "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/",

## Permissions

> **NOTE:**  
> Many operations in this library require elevated permissions to modify system files.  
> When running code that uses this library, you should use `sudo go run ...` or run your binary as root to ensure all file and service operations succeed.  
> If you build your program first, remember to run the built binary with `sudo ./yourbinary`â€”using `sudo` only during the build step is not sufficient.
